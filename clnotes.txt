Let a and b are the two integers. Which option can be used to check out that one of the numbers is positive and the other is negative?

[Hint: product of one negative and one positive number will be always negative] 

ANS - Given two integers a and b, the product of two integers is negative means either of a or b is negative.
i.e, If we multiply a*b and the result is less than 0 , it means either a or b is negative. 


ANS - a*b<0
