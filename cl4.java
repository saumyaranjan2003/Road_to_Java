//First if condition will be checked first, and it evaluates to true. Hence, the statement inside if will be executed, so it will print "Inside if ". 
//After that, else if part will be skipped. Because in if-else statements, once a condition is satisfied remaining all the conditions are skipped without evaluation.
//After exit from if-else statement, the last print statement will be executed. Hence it will next print value of x i.e. 15. 
//So the output is : "Inside if 15"
